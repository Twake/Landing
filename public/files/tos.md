By accessing and using the Services, Users agree to being bound by these TOS. Should any User disagree with any part of the present TOS, User may not use the Services.

# Definitions

The following expressions in the TOS have the meaning indicated in this section:

Content : Content is defined as any data, regardless of nature (whether information, image, video, audio, file, sign, text, signal, program, software, code, or any other element) which is available (displayed and/or downloadable) through the Services platform. User Content is a specific type of Content.

Services: Twake, a secure open source collaboration platform focused on privacy, security and digital sovereignty, which notably includes Team messaging, Storage space, Team calendar, and Task management features.

User: An User means YOU as an individual, whether acting on your own account or on the behalf of any organization (company, association, or other) which requires you to access or use the Services in a professional context. When accessing and/or using Service features or purchasing a subscription to the Services on behalf of an organization, said organization is also considered to be a User, and, as such, is fully subject to the present TOS.

User Content: User Content is defined as Content which is directly or indirectly emitted, designed and/or created by a User, and uploaded to and/or broadcast through the Services platform.

# Enforceability

By accessing and/or using the Services and their features, Users are signifying their understanding as well as their irrevocable and complete acceptance of the Terms of Service applicable at the time of such Services access and/or use.

Applicable free and open source licenses notwithstanding, no other contractual terms, regardless of origin or nature, are applicable to the accessing and/or using the Services.

The fact that LINAGORA does not enforce, at a given moment, any section of these TOS, can not be interpreted as a waiver of the right to enforce said section at a later date.

The present TOS may be updated by LINAGORA at will. Each new version of the TOS will be submitted to Users for agreement. Should an User decline to agree to an updated TOS, LINAGORA reserves the right to terminate the Service for said User.

LINAGORA undertakes to implement all appropriate measures to ensure reasonable availability of the Services. However, because of the characteristics of the distributed network that is Internet, LINAGORA can not be held responsible for the slowdowns or difficulties of access to the provided Services from other sites in the world or of external slowdowns. LINAGORA responsibility ends at the output of IP routers installed in its facilities and those of its partners in providing the Services.

In order to cover the evolution of IT environments and the Services, LINAGORA reserves the right to modify at any time the characteristics of its technical infrastructures and the choice of its suppliers. LINAGORA will make its best effort for these modifications to offer performances at least equivalent to those of the previous technical infastructures.

LINAGORA may temporarily discontinue the Service for the purpose of maintaining its server centers. These interruptions will take place at the times of the day the least detrimental to European and American network traffic. Any such interruption of Service will be notified beforehand by LINAGORA to Users by e-mail and/or display of an appropriate notice in the Services main interface. LINAGORA will endeavor to minimize the duration of these scheduled interruptions.
